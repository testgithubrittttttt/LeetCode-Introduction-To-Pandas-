- .fillna() method: The .fillna() method is called on the "quantity" column of the DataFrame (products["quantity"]). This method is used to fill NaN (missing) values in a data frame with specified values. In this case, it fills missing values with 0.

- .inplace parameter: The inplace=True parameter ensures that the changes made by .fillna() are applied directly to the original DataFrame products. This means that the original DataFrame is modified in place, rather than creating a new copy with the changes.

- Return statement: Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame, which now has missing values in the "quantity" column filled with zeros.
