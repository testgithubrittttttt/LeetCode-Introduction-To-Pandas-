import pandas as pd

def getDataframeSize(players: pd.DataFrame) -> List[int]:
    return list(players.shape)

EXPLANATION = 
Using players.shape:

Inside the function, the line return list(players. shape) directly accesses the shape attribute of the player's DataFrame. This attribute is a built-in property in Pandas that returns a tuple containing two elements:

- The first element represents the number of rows (indices) in the data frame.
- The second element represents the number of columns in the data frame.

By using list(players. shape), the function converts the tuple returned by shape into a Python list, which is the expected return type mentioned in the function definition (-> List[int]).
