Salary modification: 
Inside the function, the 'salary' column of the DataFrame is modified. This is achieved by multiplying each value in the 'salary' column by 2:

employees['salary'] = employees['salary'] * 2

This line of code accesses the 'salary' column of the DataFrame using employees['salary'], multiplies each salary value by 2, and assigns the result BACK to the 'salary' column.
