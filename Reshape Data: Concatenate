import pandas as pd

def concatenateTables(df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)#basically the axis = 0 is for the vertically and the axis = 1 is for horizontal

EXPLANATION =

- Importing Pandas: The first line import pandas as pd imports the Pandas library and aliases it as pd, a common convention in the Python community.

- Function Definition: The code defines a function named concatenateTables which takes two parameters:
   df1: This parameter is expected to be a Pandas DataFrame representing the first table.
   df2: This parameter is expected to be a Pandas DataFrame representing the second table.

- Return Statement: Inside the function, pd. concat([df1, df2], axis=0) is used to concatenate the two DataFrames vertically. Let's delve into this:
   pd.concat(): This is a Pandas function used for concatenating DataFrames.
   [df1, df2]: It takes a list of DataFrames as its first argument. Here, df1 and df2 are provided as the two DataFrames to concatenate.
   axis=0: This argument specifies the axis along which the concatenation will be performed. When axis=0, the DataFrames are stacked vertically, i.e., rows are appended.

- Return Value: The concatenated DataFrame resulting from the concatenation of df1 and df2 is returned from the function.
