    return students

EXPLANATION = 

- students['grade']=students['grade'].astype(int): 

This line selects the grade column from the student's DataFrame and uses the astype() method to convert its data type to integer (int). By assigning it back to students['grade'], the original DataFrame is updated with the corrected data type for the grade column.

- return students: 

Finally, the function returns the modified data frame.
